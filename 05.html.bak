		<p>Day 5 was wet.</p>
		<p>We were wanting to go to Bannock Burn; we did get there, but instead of wandering about the battlefield
		 we dripped in a corner of the visitors centre before pressing on.  After a break at Cullen for soup (what
		  else?) we ended up at Banff and visited family.</p>
		
		<p>No pictures, but if I had one I would post a picture of the <a href="https://www.thespottybagshop.co.uk/"
		target="_blank">Spotty Bag Shop</a> where we bought waterproofs.</p>
		
		<p>Dinner was good.</p>
