		<h1>Portmahomack</h1>
		
		<p>After the lengthy run on busy, narrow roads, a gentle run down the less popular east coast towards Portmahomack
		 was a pleasant change.  Starting with a trip to John O'Groats we followed the coastal road, seeing a sea eagle
		  not far before stopping at Brora for lunch.</p>
		
		<p>Yes that name rings a bell, so after lunch we headed for a tour of the Clynelish distillery and their newly
		 refurbished visitors centre before wandering down to Portmahomack for the evening.</p>
		 
		<p>We were looking forwards to visiting Portmahomack, thinking it might be an idyllic find, but to be honest it
		 was a bit of a forgotten backwater, and the local inn was not welcoming.  Oh well.</p>
