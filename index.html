				<p>Last year we took a lovely holiday trip to the Scottish Highlands and beyond.  We took in the sights
		of the Great Glen, Ullapool, Dunnet Head, Portmahomack, Banff and finally the Cairngorms.  I had wanted to tour
		the coast of the north of Scotland for a long time, but it had to be on two wheels.  It's taken me a while and
		now it's a "thing" but it was worth the wait!</p>

				<p>In many ways the spiritual home of motorsport, a trip to France to cheer on Zarco, Rossi and the
				 other two wheeled gladiators!  Attempting to sing La Marseillaise, exchanging greetings with the
				  Jillet Jaunes and getting lost in the madcap campsite.</p>
