		<p>Day three was one of the longest days in the saddle.  Setting off from Ullapool we headed towards Scourie
		on some of Scotland's infamous tar n chip roads, a great encouragement to keep the speed down!  Not that
		we needed much encouragement, the scenery is stunning all the way up past Scourie, great windswept volcanic
		terrain with patches of greenery clinging to it.</p>
		
		<p>By the time we reached Durness the landscape was giving way to the sea, and the tourists!  The car parks
		were heaving so, after refreshing with coffee and cake, we decided to press on until we reached Tongue for lunch.
		  Arriving at 13:30 in August I was somewhat crestfallen to discover everywhere closed!  
		  So onwards we pressed....</p>
		
		<p>Desperate for a cup of tea, sausage roll and a pee (in any order) we eventually turned off the main road
		in the little village of Bettyhill on the promise of a cafe at the local store.  What we were presented with
		was a veritable oasis for travellers weary from doing battle with overgrown campers piloted by inexperienced
		drivers.  An oasis staffed by angels, no less.</p>
