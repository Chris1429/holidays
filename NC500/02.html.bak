		<p>Day two was meant to take us over "The pass of cows" to Applecross, then on to Kinlochewe, Poolewe
		and onwards to end the day at Ullapool.  However, as we'd been up the pass the previous evening
		 when the weather was clear, with grey skies facing us we decided to skip Applecross and
		 headed towards Poolewe and the Arctic Convoy memorial and museum.</p>
		 <p>We had a pleasurable time poking around the fascinating museum just outside Poolewe and reached
		 Ullapool by mid-afternoon, just in time for coffee and cake.  This would become a holiday theme!</p>
