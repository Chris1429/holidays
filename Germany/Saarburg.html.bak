		<p>Winding its way through the Saar-Hunsruch natural park, the Saar River features many large meanders as it reaches from
		Alpine waters to its confluence with the Mosel.  The most dramatic and picturesque meander is the famous Saar Loop.  Situated
		between the towns of Orscholz and Mettlach, the Saar Loop is a winding turn of the river through from north-west
		 to south-westerly courses, and makes for a dramatic photograph, if it's sunny!</p>
		   
		<p>With a single day as our windows of opportunity, needless to say it was wet and rainy on the day we went,
		 with clouds hanging over the neighbouring forests and cloud cover resisting the suns attempts to burn through.
		  Still worth the trip just for the views!</p>
